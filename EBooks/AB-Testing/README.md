## What To Test

- You can't pick a winner until you decide how you're keeping score. A/B testing starts with determining **quantifiable success metrics**.
- There are a number of possible **conversion goals**: time on site, page views, average order value, revenue per visitor, and so on. Take the time to pick the one that's right for you.
- Site analytics along with your own instincts will suggest **bottlenecks** where you can focus your attention.
- Understanding visitor intent with the help of interviews and usability tests will suggest **hypotheses** about what to change and how.
- **Prioritize** your experiments based on your prediction of their impact.
- **Start testing**, and continue until you begin to see diminishing returns.

## Seek The Global Maximum

- Incrementalism can lead to local maxima. Be willing to **explore** to find the big wins before testing smaller changes and tweaks.
- Conversely, sometimes it's the incremental refinements that prove or disprove your hypotheses about what your users respond to. **Use the insights from small tests** to guide and inform your thinking about bigger changes.
- Consider entirely new **alternative approaches** to your principal business goals. Be willing to go beyond just testing ""variations on a theme" - you might be surprised.
- If you're working on a major site redesign or overhaul, don't wait until the new design is live to A/B test it. **A/B test the redesign** itself.

## Less Is More

- More technologically or visually impressive pages don't necessarily lead to the user behavior you want. Experiment with **keeping it simple** and make any additional complexity earn its keep in your key success metrics.
- Every form field that users have to fill out is one more point of resistance between them and their conversion. Consider **deleting optional fields** and seeing if that lifts conversion.
- Giving visitors fewer distractions and fewer changes to leave the checkout funnel by **removing choices** can help boost conversion rates.
- Long forms have high risk for conversion failure. **Breaking up a long form** with required fields into multiple pages can increase changes for conversion.

## Words Matter

- There are endless word combinations to use on your website. Don't be afraid to **brainstorm and think broadly**: a testing platform **lowers the "barrier to entry"** of ideas, minimizes the risks of failure, and enables quick and potentially huge wins.
- Decisions around messaging and verbiage can easily lead to contentious debates on a team. A/B testing is a way to **put opinions aside** and get concrete feedback on what works and what doesn't.
- If you want someone to do something, **tell them to do it**.
- Different ways of **framing** the same message can cause people to think of it in different ways. Play with alternative ways of framing the same information and see what differences emerge.

## Fail Fast And Learn

- What works for **returning users** may not work for new users, and vice-versa.
- **Something that works on one page may not work on another**; something that works at one scale may not work at another.
- What one type of user wants may not be what another type of user wants. A failed test, sometimes more than a successful test, may prompt a drill-down that reveals a **key difference between segments of users**.
- Sometimes a variation may win against the original, but it may not **win by enough of a margin** to justify the implementation overhead or other drawbacks of the variation that are external to the test itself.
- Any test that reveals that an initiative isn't performing is a blessing in disguise: it allows you to **free up resources** from things that aren't working and divert them to the things that are.

## Choose The Right Solution

- Building your own testing platform requires a significant and ongoing engineering investment, but can ultimately provide the greatest level of control and the **tightest integration** with your team and deployment cycles.
- An **A/A test** is a helpful way to ensure that your solution is functioning, reporting, and analyzing correctly.
- Many A/B testing SaaS platforms are easy to use **without requiring engineering support**: marketers and product people without a coding background can create and run variations in a visual "What You See Is What You Get" environment.
- An agency can help your team with the **ideation** of tests, **execution** of tests, or both.
- When picking the solution that best fits your company, consider making **key stakeholders** part of the exploration process. The earlier you bring others on board, the easier it will be to get buy-in.

## The Cure For HIPPO Syndrome

- In some workplaces, and to varying degrees, the **HiPPo Syndrome** holds sway, but often all it takes are a few humble tests and a curiosity and interest in testing begin to take root.
- Allay the wary with the reassurance that you're not proposing sudden changes: it's "**just an experiment.**"
- In month one, run a test that is politically palatable and easy enough that it can show a **quick win.** Product pages can be a great place to start.
- **Share wins** not only with your immediate boss but, if possible, with the company at large. Communication is key in getting people to care about testing.
- Get creative with how you **introduce stakeholders and co-workers** to A/B testing.

## The Dream Team

- A/B testing is by nature **inter-disciplinary** and **cross-departmental**. Collaboration is key.
- Some companies have a **centralized testing team** responsible for coordinating and executing all A/B tests company-wide.
- Other organizations adopt a **decentralized** model, where each product owner/manager is responsible for testing within his or her product domain.
- Regardless of which structure you adopt, make sure there is at least one **point person** within the organization whom people can come to about all things testing.
- Ensure your point person or team maintains **allies across your organization** to ensure that testing is part of your planning process.
- Make sure that your testers are enabled and **empowered to be creative**, and that the friction of running and iterating new tests is low.
- **Maintain records** about who tested what and when, how the test was set up, and what the result was. This will enable your organization to work collaboratively to build up a set of collective wisdom and best practices.
