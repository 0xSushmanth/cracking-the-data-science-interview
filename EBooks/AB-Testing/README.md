# AB Testing

This is my notes from the book "[A/B Testing](https://www.amazon.com/Testing-Most-Powerful-Clicks-Customers/dp/1118792416)" written by Optimizely's co-founders, Dan Siroker and Pete Koomen.

## What To Test

- You can't pick a winner until you decide how you're keeping score. A/B testing starts with determining **quantifiable success metrics**.
- There are a number of possible **conversion goals**: time on site, page views, average order value, revenue per visitor, and so on. Take the time to pick the one that's right for you.
- Site analytics along with your own instincts will suggest **bottlenecks** where you can focus your attention.
- Understanding visitor intent with the help of interviews and usability tests will suggest **hypotheses** about what to change and how.
- **Prioritize** your experiments based on your prediction of their impact.
- **Start testing**, and continue until you begin to see diminishing returns.

## Seek The Global Maximum

- Incrementalism can lead to local maxima. Be willing to **explore** to find the big wins before testing smaller changes and tweaks.
- Conversely, sometimes it's the incremental refinements that prove or disprove your hypotheses about what your users respond to. **Use the insights from small tests** to guide and inform your thinking about bigger changes.
- Consider entirely new **alternative approaches** to your principal business goals. Be willing to go beyond just testing ""variations on a theme" - you might be surprised.
- If you're working on a major site redesign or overhaul, don't wait until the new design is live to A/B test it. **A/B test the redesign** itself.

## Less Is More

- More technologically or visually impressive pages don't necessarily lead to the user behavior you want. Experiment with **keeping it simple** and make any additional complexity earn its keep in your key success metrics.
- Every form field that users have to fill out is one more point of resistance between them and their conversion. Consider **deleting optional fields** and seeing if that lifts conversion.
- Giving visitors fewer distractions and fewer changes to leave the checkout funnel by **removing choices** can help boost conversion rates.
- Long forms have high risk for conversion failure. **Breaking up a long form** with required fields into multiple pages can increase changes for conversion.

## Words Matter

- There are endless word combinations to use on your website. Don't be afraid to **brainstorm and think broadly**: a testing platform **lowers the "barrier to entry"** of ideas, minimizes the risks of failure, and enables quick and potentially huge wins.
- Decisions around messaging and verbiage can easily lead to contentious debates on a team. A/B testing is a way to **put opinions aside** and get concrete feedback on what works and what doesn't.
- If you want someone to do something, **tell them to do it**.
- Different ways of **framing** the same message can cause people to think of it in different ways. Play with alternative ways of framing the same information and see what differences emerge.
