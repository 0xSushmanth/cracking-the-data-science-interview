## What To Test

- You can't pick a winner until you decide how you're keeping score. A/B testing starts with determining **quantifiable success metrics**.
- There are a number of possible **conversion goals**: time on site, page views, average order value, revenue per visitor, and so on. Take the time to pick the one that's right for you.
- Site analytics along with your own instincts will suggest **bottlenecks** where you can focus your attention.
- Understanding visitor intent with the help of interviews and usability tests will suggest **hypotheses** about what to change and how.
- **Prioritize** your experiments based on your prediction of their impact.
- **Start testing**, and continue until you begin to see diminishing returns.
