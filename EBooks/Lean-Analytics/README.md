# Lean Analytics

This is my notes from the book "[Lean Analytics](http://leananalyticsbook.com/)" written by Alistair Croll and Benjamin Yoskovitz.

Here are the sections and chapters:

**Section 1 - Stop Lying To Yourself**

- [Chapter 1 - We Are All Liars](#chapter-1-we-are-all-liars)
- [Chapter 2 - How To Keep Score](#chapter-2-how-to-keep-score)

**Section 2 - Finding The Right Metric For Right Now**

**Section 3 - Lines In The Sand**

**Section 4 - Putting Lean Analytics To Work**

## Chapter 1 - We Are All Liars

- Instincts are experiments. Data is proof.
- Lean analytical thinking is about asking the right questions and focusing on the one key metric that will produce the change you are after.

## Chapter 2 - How To Keep Score

- [What Makes A Good Metric?](#what-makes-a-good-metric?)

### What Makes A Good Metric?

Rules of thumb for a good metric:
- A good metric is comparative.
- A good metric is understandable.
- A good metric is a ratio or a rate.
- A good metric change the way you behave.

**Qualitative Versus Quantitative Metrics**

- Quantitative data is easy to understand. It is nice and scientific, and you can aggregate it, extrapolate it, and put it into a spreadsheet.
- Qualitative data is messy, subjective, and imprecise. It's the stuff of interviews and debates. It's hard to quantify.

**Vanity Versus Real Metrics**

Avoid these 8 vanity metrics:
- Number of hits.
- Number of page views.
- Number of visits.
- Number of unique visitors.
- Number of followers/friends/likes.
- Time on site / number of pages.
- Emails collected.
- Number of downloads.

**Exploratory Versus Reporting Metrics**

- Analytics can check our facts and assumptions to be sure we are not kidding ourselves, and check that our business plans are accurate.
- Analytics can test our intuitions, turning hypotheses into evidence.
- Analytics can provide the data for our spreadsheets, waterfall charts, and board meetings.
- Analytics can help us find the nugget of opportunity on which to build a business.

**Leading Versus Lagging Metrics**

- A leading metric (*current number of sales prospects*) tries to predict the future. A lagging metric (*churn*) gives you an indication that there's a problem.
- In the early days of your startup, you won't have enough data to know how a current metric relates to one down the road, so measure lagging metrics at first.
  - Lagging metrics are useful and can provide a solid baseline of performance.
  - For leading metrics to work, you need to be able to do cohort analysis and compare groups of customers over periods of time.

**Correlated Versus Causal Metrics**

- Correlation is good. Causality is great.
- Sometimes, you may have to settle for the former - but you should always be trying to discover the latter.
