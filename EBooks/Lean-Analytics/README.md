# Lean Analytics

This is my notes from the book "[Lean Analytics](http://leananalyticsbook.com/)" written by Alistair Croll and Benjamin Yoskovitz.

Here are the sections and chapters:

**Section 1 - Stop Lying To Yourself**

- [Chapter 1 - We Are All Liars](#chapter-1-we-are-all-liars)

**Section 2 - Finding The Right Metric For Right Now**

**Section 3 - Lines In The Sand**

**Section 4 - Putting Lean Analytics To Work**

## Chapter 1 - We Are All Liars

- Instincts are experiments. Data is proof.
- Lean analytical thinking is about asking the right questions and focusing on the one key metric that will produce the change you are after.
