# Lean Analytics

This is my notes from the book "[Lean Analytics](http://leananalyticsbook.com/)" written by Alistair Croll and Benjamin Yoskovitz.

Here are the sections and chapters:

**Section 1 - Stop Lying To Yourself**

- Chapter 1: [We Are All Liars](#we-are-all-liars)
- Chapter 2: [How To Keep Score](#how-to-keep-score)
- Chapter 3: [What To Do With Your Life](#what-to-do-with-your-life)

**Section 2 - Finding The Right Metric For Right Now**

**Section 3 - Lines In The Sand**

**Section 4 - Putting Lean Analytics To Work**

## We Are All Liars

- Instincts are experiments. Data is proof.
- Lean analytical thinking is about asking the right questions and focusing on the one key metric that will produce the change you are after.

## How To Keep Score

- [Good Metric](#good-metric)
- [Testing](#testing)

### Good Metric

Rules of thumb for a good metric:
- A good metric is comparative.
- A good metric is understandable.
- A good metric is a ratio or a rate.
- A good metric change the way you behave.

**Qualitative Versus Quantitative Metrics**

- Quantitative data is easy to understand. It is nice and scientific, and you can aggregate it, extrapolate it, and put it into a spreadsheet.
- Qualitative data is messy, subjective, and imprecise. It's the stuff of interviews and debates. It's hard to quantify.

**Vanity Versus Real Metrics**

Avoid these 8 vanity metrics:
- Number of hits.
- Number of page views.
- Number of visits.
- Number of unique visitors.
- Number of followers/friends/likes.
- Time on site / number of pages.
- Emails collected.
- Number of downloads.

**Exploratory Versus Reporting Metrics**

- Analytics can check our facts and assumptions to be sure we are not kidding ourselves, and check that our business plans are accurate.
- Analytics can test our intuitions, turning hypotheses into evidence.
- Analytics can provide the data for our spreadsheets, waterfall charts, and board meetings.
- Analytics can help us find the nugget of opportunity on which to build a business.

**Leading Versus Lagging Metrics**

- A leading metric (*current number of sales prospects*) tries to predict the future. A lagging metric (*churn*) gives you an indication that there's a problem.
- In the early days of your startup, you won't have enough data to know how a current metric relates to one down the road, so measure lagging metrics at first.
  - Lagging metrics are useful and can provide a solid baseline of performance.
  - For leading metrics to work, you need to be able to do cohort analysis and compare groups of customers over periods of time.

**Correlated Versus Causal Metrics**

- Correlation is good. Causality is great.
- Sometimes, you may have to settle for the former - but you should always be trying to discover the latter.

### Testing

- Testing usually involves comparing two things against each other through segmentation, cohort analysis, or A/B testing.
- A **segment** is simply a group that shares some common characteristic. Segmentation works for any industry and any form of marketing, not just for websites.
- Each group of users is a **cohort** - participants in an experiment across their lifecycle. You can compare cohorts against one another to see if, on the whole, key metrics are getting better over time.
- When we compare one attribute of a subject's experience and assume everything else is equal, we are doing **A/B testing**.
- **Multivariate analysis** includes analyzing multiple tests at once to see which correlates strongly with an improvement in a key metric.

## What To Do With Your Life

### The Lean Canvas

The Lean Canvas is fantastic at identifying the areas of biggest risk and enforcing intellectual honesty. Consider the following:
1. **Problem**: Have you identified real problems people know they have?
2. **Customer Segments**: Do you know your target markets? Do you know how to target messages to them as distinct groups?
3. **Unique Value Proposition**: Have you found a clear, distinctive, memorable way to explain why you're better or different?
4. **Solution**: Can you solve the problems in the right way?
5. **Channels**: How will you get your product or service to your customers, and their money back to you?
6. **Revenue Streams**: Where will the money come from? Will it be one-time or recurring? The result of a direct transaction or something indirect?
7. **Cost Structure**: What are the direct, variable, and indirect costs you'll have to pay for when you run the business?
8. **Metrics**: Do you know what numbers to track to understand if you're making progress?
9. **Unfair advantage**: What is the "force multiplier" that will make your efforts have greater impact than your competitors?
