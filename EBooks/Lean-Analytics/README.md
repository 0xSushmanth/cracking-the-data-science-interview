## We Are All Liars

- Instincts are experiments. Data is proof.
- Lean analytical thinking is about asking the right questions and focusing on the one key metric that will produce the change you are after.

### Good Metric

Rules of thumb for a good metric:
- A good metric is comparative.
- A good metric is understandable.
- A good metric is a ratio or a rate.
- A good metric change the way you behave.

**Qualitative Versus Quantitative Metrics**

- Quantitative data is easy to understand. It is nice and scientific, and you can aggregate it, extrapolate it, and put it into a spreadsheet.
- Qualitative data is messy, subjective, and imprecise. It's the stuff of interviews and debates. It's hard to quantify.

**Vanity Versus Real Metrics**

Avoid these 8 vanity metrics:
- Number of hits.
- Number of page views.
- Number of visits.
- Number of unique visitors.
- Number of followers/friends/likes.
- Time on site / number of pages.
- Emails collected.
- Number of downloads.

**Exploratory Versus Reporting Metrics**

- Analytics can check our facts and assumptions to be sure we are not kidding ourselves, and check that our business plans are accurate.
- Analytics can test our intuitions, turning hypotheses into evidence.
- Analytics can provide the data for our spreadsheets, waterfall charts, and board meetings.
- Analytics can help us find the nugget of opportunity on which to build a business.

**Leading Versus Lagging Metrics**

- A leading metric (*current number of sales prospects*) tries to predict the future. A lagging metric (*churn*) gives you an indication that there's a problem.
- In the early days of your startup, you won't have enough data to know how a current metric relates to one down the road, so measure lagging metrics at first.
  - Lagging metrics are useful and can provide a solid baseline of performance.
  - For leading metrics to work, you need to be able to do cohort analysis and compare groups of customers over periods of time.

**Correlated Versus Causal Metrics**

- Correlation is good. Causality is great.
- Sometimes, you may have to settle for the former - but you should always be trying to discover the latter.

### Testing

- Testing usually involves comparing two things against each other through segmentation, cohort analysis, or A/B testing.
- A **segment** is simply a group that shares some common characteristic. Segmentation works for any industry and any form of marketing, not just for websites.
- Each group of users is a **cohort** - participants in an experiment across their lifecycle. You can compare cohorts against one another to see if, on the whole, key metrics are getting better over time.
- When we compare one attribute of a subject's experience and assume everything else is equal, we are doing **A/B testing**.
- **Multivariate analysis** includes analyzing multiple tests at once to see which correlates strongly with an improvement in a key metric.

## What To Do With Your Life

### The Lean Canvas

The Lean Canvas is fantastic at identifying the areas of biggest risk and enforcing intellectual honesty. Consider the following:
1. **Problem**: Have you identified real problems people know they have?
2. **Customer Segments**: Do you know your target markets? Do you know how to target messages to them as distinct groups?
3. **Unique Value Proposition**: Have you found a clear, distinctive, memorable way to explain why you're better or different?
4. **Solution**: Can you solve the problems in the right way?
5. **Channels**: How will you get your product or service to your customers, and their money back to you?
6. **Revenue Streams**: Where will the money come from? Will it be one-time or recurring? The result of a direct transaction or something indirect?
7. **Cost Structure**: What are the direct, variable, and indirect costs you'll have to pay for when you run the business?
8. **Metrics**: Do you know what numbers to track to understand if you're making progress?
9. **Unfair advantage**: What is the "force multiplier" that will make your efforts have greater impact than your competitors?

### What To Work On
- If you want to do something and are good at it, but can't be paid to do it, *learn to monetize*.
- If you are good at something and can be paid to do it, but don't like doing it, *learn to say no*.
- If you like to do something and can be paid to do it, but aren't very good at it, *learn to do it well*.

## Data Driven and Data Informed

- Lean Startup is focused on learning above everything else, and encourages broad thinking, exploration, and experimentation.
- Lean Startup helps expand your vision, because you're encouraged to question everything.

## Analytics Frameworks

1. **Empathy**: I've found a real, poorly met need a reachable market faces.
2. **Stickiness**: I've figured out how to solve the problem in a way they will accept and pay for.
3. **Virality**: I've built the right product/features/functionality that keeps users around.
4. **Revenue**: The users and features fuel growth organically and artificially.
5. **Scale**: I've found a sustainable, scalable business with the right margins in a healthy ecosystem.
-> I can achieve a successful exit for the right terms.

## One Metric That Matters

The One Metric That Matters is the one number you are completely focused on above everything else for your current stage.
- It answers the most important question you have.
- It forces you to draw a line in the sand and have clear goals.
- It focuses the entire company.
- It inspires a culture of experimentation.

## Business Models

Business growth comes from improving one of these five "knobs":
- **More stuff** means adding products or services, preferably those you know your customers want so you don't waste time building things they won't use or buy.
- **More people** means adding users, ideally through virality or word of mouth, but also through paid advertising. The best way to add users is when it's an integral part of product use since this happens automatically and implies an endorsement from the inviting user.
- **More often** means stickiness, reduced churn, and repeated use. Early on, stickiness tends to be a key knob on which to focus, because until your core early adopters find your product superb, it's unlikely you can achieve good viral marketing.
- **More money** means upselling and maximizing the price users will pay, or the revenue from ad clicks, or the amount of content they create, or the number of in-game purchases they make.
- **More efficiently**  means reducing the cost of delivering and supporting your service, but also lowering the cost of customer acquisition by doing less paid advertising and more word of mouth.

The 5 aspects of any business model:
1. **Acquisition channel**: How the visitor, customer, or user finds out about the startup.
  - Paid advertising
  - Search engine management
  - Social media outreach
  - Inherent and artificial virality
  - Affiliate marketing
  - Public relations
  - App and ecosystem marketing
2. **Selling tactic**: What the startup does to convince the visitor or user to become a paying customer.
  - Simple purchases
  - Discounts and incentives
  - Free trial
  - Freemium
  - Pay-for-privacy
  - Free-to-pay
3. **Revenue model**: How the startup extracts money from its visitors, users, or customers.
  - One-time transaction
  - Recurring subscription
  - Consumption charges
  - Advertising clicks
  - Resale of user data
  - Donation
4. **Product type**: What the startup does in return.
  - Software
  - Platform
  - Merchandising
  - User-generated content
  - Marketplace
  - Media/content
  - Service
5. **Delivery model**: How the product gets to the customer.
  - Hosted service
  - Digital/physical delivery

## Ecommerce

### Overview
- In an e-commerce company, a visitor buys something from a web-based retailer. This is perhaps the most common kind of online business, and it's certainly the one that the majority of traditional analytics tools are aimed at.
- Early e-commerce models consisted of a relatively simple "funnel": a visitor arrived at the site, navigated through a series of pages to get to a particular item, clicked "buy", provided some payment information, and completed a purchase.
- But modern e-commerce is seldom this simple:
  - The majority of buyers find what they're looking for through search rather than by navigating across a series of pages. Shoppers start with an external search and then bounce back and forth from sites they visit to their search results, seeking the scent of what they're after. Once they find it, on-site navigation becomes more important. This means on-site funnels are somewhat outdated; keywords are more important.
  - Retailers use recommendation engines to anticipate what else a buyer might want, basing their suggestions on past buyers and other users with similar profiles. Few visitors see the same pages as one another.
  - Retailers are always optimizing performance, which means that they're segmenting traffic. Mid- to large-size retailers segment their funnel by several tests that are being run to find the right products, offers, and prices.
  - Purchases begin far from the website itself, in social networks, email inboxes, and online communities, making the buying process harder to track.

### Key Metrics

1. **Conversion Rate** is the percentage of visitors to your site who buy something.
  - It's simple to calculate and experiment with. You'll slice conversion rate in many ways to see what makes people more likely to buy.
  - Early on, conversion rate may even be more important than total revenue because your initial goal is to simply prove that someone will buy something.
  - Conversion rate is highly dependent on your type of e-commerce business, and whether your success will be driven by loyalty, new customer acquisition, or a hybrid of the two.

2. **Purchases Per Year** refer to the number of purchases made by each customer per year.
  - If you look at the repurchase rate on a 90-day cycle, it becomes a very good leading indicator for what type of e-commerce site you have.
  - It helps to know whether to focus more on loyalty or more on acquisition.

3. **Shopping Cart Size** is the amount of money spent on a purchase.
  - You may find that one campaign is more likely to make people buy, but another might make fewer people spend more money.
  - You'll compare the total revenue you're generating to the way in which you acquired that revenue, in order to identify the most lucrative segments of your reachable audience.

4. **Abandonment** is the percentage of people who begin to make a purchase, and then don't.
  - The number of people who abandon a funnel at each of the stages is the abandonment rate.
  - It's important to analyze it for each step in order to see which parts of the process are hurting you the most.

5. **Cost of Customer Acquisition** is the money spent to get someone to buy something.
  - You'll want to drive traffic to the site via ads, social media outreach, mailing lists, or affiliates.
  - You can use analytics tools when there are myriad channels driving traffic to the site.

6. **Revenue Per Customer** is the lifetime value of each customer.
  - It is an aggregate metric of other key numbers, and represents a good, single measure of your e-commerce business's health.

7. **Keywords and Search Terms** are terms that people look for and associate with the site.
  - For paid search, you bid against others for popular keywords in search engines like Google.
  - For unpaid search, you focus on good and compelling content that improves your ranking with search engines, and on writing copy that includes the desirable search terms your paying customers tend to use.

8. **Recommendation Effectiveness** explains how likely a visitor will add a recommended product to the shopping cart.
  - There are many different approaches to recommendations: past purchases and visitor attributes (geography, referral, clicked items, etc.)
  - How much additional revenue generated through recommendations?

9. **Virality** means of word-of-mouth sharing per visitor.
  - It has the lowest cost of customer acquisition and the highest implied recommendation from someone the recipient trusts.

10. **Mailing List Effectiveness** explains the CTRs and ability to make buyers return and buy.
  - You calculate the email CTR by dividing the number of visits you get from a campaign by the number of messages you've sent. A more sophisticated analysis of email CTR will include a breakdown of the various places where things can go wrong and a look at the eventual outcome you're after.
  - You also need to create a campaign contribution metric - basically, the added revenue from the campaign, minus the cost of the campaign and the loss due to unsubscribes.

### Key Takeaways
- It's vital to know if you're focused on loyalty or acquisition. This drives your whole marketing strategy and many of the features you build.
- Searches, both off- and on-site, are an increasingly common way of finding something for purchase.
- While conversion rates, repeat purchases, and transaction sizes are important, the ultimate metric is the product of the three of them: revenue per customer.
- Don't overlook real-world considerations like shipping, warehouse logistics, and inventory.

## SaaS

### Overview

- A SaaS company offers software on an on-demand basis, usually delivered through a website it operates.
- Most SaaS providers generate revenue from a monthly (or yearly) subscription that users pay.
- Many SaaS providers offer a tiered model of their service, where the monthly fee varies depending on some dimension of the application. This might be the number of projects in a project management tool, or the number of customers in a customer relationship management application.
- Because the incremental cost of adding another customer to a SaaS service is negligible, many SaaS providers use a freemium model of customer acquisition. Customers can start using a free version of the service that's constrained, in the hopes that they'll consume all the free capacity and pay for more.

### Key Metrics

1. **Attention** measures how effectively the business attracts visitors.
2. **Enrollment** measures how many visitors become free or trial users.
3. **Stickiness** measures how much the customers use the product.
4. **Conversion** measures how many of the users become paying customers, and how many of those switch to a higher-paying tier.
5. **Revenue Per Customer** measures how much money a customer brings in within a given time period.
6. **Virality** measures how likely customers to invite others and spread the word, and how long it takes them do so.
7. **Upselling** measures what makes customers increase their spending, and how often that happens.
8. **Uptime and Reliability** measures how many complaints, problem escalations, or outages the company has.
9. **Churn** measures how many users and customers leave in a given time period.
10. **Lifetime value** measures how much customers are worth from cradle to grave.

### Measuring Engagement

- The ultimate metric for engagement is daily use.
  - If your product isn't a daily use app, establishing a minimum baseline of engagement takes longer, and the time it takes to iterate through a cycle of learning is longer.
  - It's also hard to demonstrate enough value, quickly enough, to keep people from churning.
- When measuring engagement, don't just look at a coarse metric like visit frequency. Look for usage patterns throughout your application by analyzing data in two ways:
  - To find ways you might improve things, segment users who do what you want from those who don't, and identify ways in which they're different.
  - To decide whether a change worked, test the change on a subset of your users and compare that subset's results to others.

### Churn

- Churn is the percentage of people who abandon your service over time. This can be measured weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc., but you should pick a timespan for all your metrics and stick to it in order to make comparing them easier.
- The simple formula for churn is: `(Number of churns during period) / (# of customers at beginning of period)`. However, this formula isn't normalized for behavior and size.
- A more accurate formula averages out the number of customers in the period analyzed: `(Number of churns during period) / [(# of customers at beginning of period) + (# of customers at end of period)] / 2`
- Ultimately, the math gets really complex. There are two ways to simplify it:
  - Measure churn by cohort, so you compare new to churned users based on when they first became users.
  - Measure churn each day. The shorter the time period you measure, the less that changes during that specific period will distort things.

### Key Takeaways
- While freemium gets a lot of visibility, it's actually a sales tactic, and one you need to use carefully.
- In SaaS, churn is everything. If you can build a group of loyal users faster than they erode, you'll thrive.
- You need to measure user engagement long before the users become customers, and measure customer activity long before they vanish, to stay ahead of the game.
- Many people equate SaaS models with subscription, but you can monetize on-demand software in many other ways, sometimes to great effect.
