# Practical Statistics For Data Scientists

Code associated with the book "[Practical Statistics for Data Scientists: 50 Essential Concepts](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Statistics-Data-Scientists-Essential/dp/1491952962)"

The scripts are stored by chapter and replicate most of the figures and code snippets.

**HOW TO GET THE DATA**:
* Run R script:
* The data is not saved on github and you will need to download the data.
* You can do this in R using the sript `src/download_data.r`. This will copy the data into the data directory ~/statistics-for-data-scientists/data.

**Manual download**:
Alternatively, you can manually download the files from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B98qpkK5EJemYnJ1ajA1ZVJwMzg or from https://www.dropbox.com/sh/clb5aiswr7ar0ci/AABBNwTcTNey2ipoSw_kH5gra?dl=0

**IMPORTANT NOTE**:
The scripts all assume that you have cloned the repository into the top level home directory (~/). If you save the repository elsewhere, you will need to edit the line:
```
  PSDS_PATH <- file.path('~', 'statistics-for-data-scientists')
```
to point to the appropriate directory in all of the scripts.

* [Rectangular Data](#rectangular-data)
* [Estimates of Location](#estimates-of-location)
* [Estimates of Variability](#estimates-of-variability)
* [Exploring the Data Distribution](#exploring-the-data-distribution)
* [Exploring Binary and Categorical Data](#exploring-binary-and-categorical-data)
* [Correlation](#correlation)
* [Exploring Two or More Variables](#exploring-two-or-more-variables)

### Elements of Structured Data

* Data is typically classified in software by type.
* Data types include continuous, discrete, categorical, and ordinal.
* Data typing in software acts as a signal to the software on how to process the data.

### Rectangular Data

* The basic data structure in data science is a rectangular matrix in which rows are records and columns are variables/features.
* Terminology can be confusing; there are a variety of synonyms arising from the different disciplines that contribute to data science (statistics, computer science, and information technology).

### Estimates of Location

* The basic metric for location is the mean, but it can be sensitive to extreme values (outliers).
* Other metrics (median, trimmed mean) are more robust.

### Estimates of Variability

* The variance and standard deviation are the most widespread and routinely reported statistics of variability.
* Both are sensitive to outliers.
* More robust metrics include mean and median absolute deviations from the mean and percentiles (quantiles).

### Exploring the Data Distribution

* A frequency histogram plots frequency counts on the y-axis and variable values on the x-axis; it gives a sense of the distribution of the data at a glance.
* A frequency table is a tabular version of the frequency counts found in a histogram.
* A boxplot - with the top and bottom of the box at the 75th and 25th percentiles, respectively - also gives a quick sense of the distribution of the data; it is often used in side-by-side displays to compare distributions.
* A density plot is a smoothed version of a histogram; it requires a function to estimate a plot based on the data (multiple estimates are possible, of course).

### Exploring Binary and Categorical Data

* Categorical data is typically summed up in proportions, and can be visualized in a bar chart.
* Categories might represent distinct things (apples and oranges, male and female), levels of a factor variable (low, medium, and high), or numeric data that has been binned.
* Expected value is the sum of values times their probability of occurrence, often used to sum up factor variable levels.

### Correlation

* The correlation coefficient measures the extent to which two variables are associated with one another.
* When high values of v1 go with high values of v2, v1 and v2 are positively associated.
* When high values of v1 are associated with low values of v2, v1 and v2 are negatively associated.
* The correlation coefficient is a standardized metric so that it always ranges from -1 to +1.
* A correlation coefficient of 0 indicates no correlation, but be aware that random arrangements of data will produce both positive and negative values for the correlation coefficient just by chance.

### Exploring Two or More Variables

* Hexagonal binning and contour plots are useful tools that permit graphical examination of 2 numeric variables at a time, without being overwhelmed by huge amounts of data.
* Contingency tables are the standard tool for looking at the counts of 2 categorical variables.
* Boxplots and violin plots allow you to plot a numeric variable against a categorical variable.
