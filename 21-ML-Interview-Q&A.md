# 21 Machine Learning Interview Questions and Answers

## 1. The Big Picture
**Essential ML theory, such as the Bias-Variance tradeoff**

### 1.1 - What are parametric models? Give an example.
Parametric models are those with a finite number of parameters. To predict new data, you only need to know the parameters of the model. Examples include linear regression, logistic regression, and linear SVMs.

Non-parametric models are those with an unbounded number of parameters, allowing for more flexibility. To predict new data, you need to know the parameters of the model and the state of the data that has been observed. Examples include decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, and topic models using latent dirichlet analysis.

### 1.2 - What is the "Curse of Dimensionality?"
The difficulty of searching through a solution space becomes much harder as you have more features (dimensions).

Consider the analogy of looking for a penny in a line vs. a field vs. a building. The more dimensions you have, the higher volume of data you'll need.

### 1.3 - Explain the Bias-Variance Tradeoff.
Predictive models have a tradeoff between bias (how well the model fits the data) and variance (how much the model changes based on changes in the inputs).

Simpler models are stable (low variance) but they don't get close to the truth (high bias).

More complex models are more prone to being overfit (high variance) but they are expressive enough to get close to the truth (low bias).

The best model for a given problem usually lies somewhere in the middle.
