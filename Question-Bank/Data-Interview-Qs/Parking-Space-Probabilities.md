## Question
Suppose you're analyzing the utilization of a small parking lot you invested in. Customers enter the automated lot, receive a ticket, and select one of 20 spots at random (e.g. they are not assigned). Upon leaving, customers pay in relation to their time in the lot.

You have collected the following [dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rpTArHXCSMV0_WryClhhmQfDZzSEACt_EuLh8rxuvDU/edit#gid=0), which shows spot utilization for a month. Each # in the dataset corresponds to a spot # (1-20) and the # of times it appears in a row corresponds to the frequency of how many customers parked in that spot.

Using all of this information, write code to visualize the [Probability Mass Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_mass_function) (PMF) of your customers' spot selections. Your resultant chart should show each spot # (1-20) along with the probability of that spot being chosen based on your dataset. You can ignore seasonality and assume this month represents a standard month of parking at your lot.
