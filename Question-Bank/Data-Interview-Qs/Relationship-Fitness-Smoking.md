## Question
Given the data table below, determine if there is a relationship between fitness level and smoking habits:

|                         | Low Fitness Level | Medium-Low Fitness Level | Medium-High Fitness Level | High Fitness Level |
|:-----------------------:|:-----------------:|:------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:------------------:|
|       Never Smoked      |        113        |            113           |            110            |         159        |
|      Former Smokers     |        119        |            135           |            172            |         190        |
| 1 to 9 Cigarettes Daily |         77        |            91            |             86            |         65         |
|  >=10 Cigarettes Daily  |        181        |            152           |            124            |         73         |

You don't have to fully solve for the number here (that would be pretty time-intensive for an interview setting), but lay out the steps you would take to solve such a problem.
