* [CS229 - Machine Learning](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-229/)
* [CS230 - Deep Learning](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-230/)

There is also the [SQL Cheatsheet](https://github.com/khanhnamle1994/cracking-the-data-science-interview/tree/master/Cheatsheets/SQL-Cheatsheet.md), which is a quick reminder of all relevant SQL queries and examples on how to use them.
